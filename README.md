OVERVIEW:
The project aims to create a basic calculator using Java programming language. The calculator will prompt the user to enter two numbers and select an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division). Based on the user's input, the program will perform the selected operation and display the result to the user.

FEATURES:
User Input: The program will prompt the user to enter two numbers.
Operation Selection: After entering the numbers, the user will be prompted to choose an operation from addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.
Calculation: Based on the selected operation, the program will perform the calculation using the provided numbers.
Error Handling: The program will handle division by zero error gracefully.
Display Result: Finally, the program will display the result of the calculation to the user.

IMPLEMENTATION:
The project will be implemented in Java programming language.
It will use the Scanner class to take user input from the console.
A switch-case statement will be used to perform different operations based on user choice.
Error handling will be implemented to handle division by zero error.
The program will display the result of the calculation to the user.

RESULTS:

CONCLUSION:
The Simple Calculator project successfully fulfills its objective of providing basic arithmetic operations to users. Through Java programming, it efficiently prompts users for two numbers and allows them to choose an operation. The program then accurately computes the result based on the selected operation, including handling division by zero errors. Overall, this project offers a user-friendly and functional calculator experience.
